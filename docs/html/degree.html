                <h2>What is Computer Science (CS)</h2>
                <p class="definition">Computer science is the study of computation, information, and automation. Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software). Though more often considered an academic discipline, computer science is closely related to computer programming.</p>

            <h1>The most important Subjects</h1>
            <p class="psubjects">
                In this degree you can find a lot of subjects, I will be talking about the first year subjects.
            </p>
            <h2 class="subjects">Mathematics for engineering</h2>
            <p class="psubjects">Mathematics for engineering is a branch of mathematics specifically tailored to address and solve problems encountered in various engineering disciplines. It includes topics such as calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, and numerical methods, providing the mathematical foundation necessary for analyzing and designing engineering systems.</p>
            <h2 class="subjects">Discrete mathematics</h2>
            <p class="psubjects">Discrete mathematics focuses on mathematical structures and concepts that are countable or distinct. It includes topics such as set theory, logic, graph theory, combinatorics, and algorithms. Discrete mathematics plays a crucial role in computer science and provides the theoretical underpinnings for various algorithms and data structures.</p>
            <h2 class="subjects">Fundamentals of computer engineering</h2>
            <p class="psubjects">Fundamentals of computer engineering introduces students to the foundational principles of computer systems and hardware. Topics covered may include digital logic, computer architecture, microprocessors, and basic electronic circuits. This course provides a fundamental understanding of the hardware components that form the basis of modern computing devices.</p>
            <a href="../html/fundamental.html" class="psubjects" id="fundamentos"><p>I have a web talking about this subject, press anywhere this link and go to see it</p></a>
            <h2 class="subjects">Introduction to programming</h2>
            <p class="psubjects">Introduction to programming is a course designed to familiarize students with the basics of computer programming. It typically covers programming languages such as Python, Java, or C++, and introduces fundamental concepts like variables, control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming. This course is a gateway for students to develop problem-solving skills and the ability to write software.</p>
            <h2 class="subjects">Humanities classes</h2>
            <p class="psubjects">Humanities classes encompass a broad range of subjects within the liberal arts, including literature, philosophy, history, and social sciences. These classes are designed to provide students with a well-rounded education, fostering critical thinking, cultural awareness, and communication skills. Humanities courses contribute to the development of a holistic understanding of the human experience and its impact on society.</p>
