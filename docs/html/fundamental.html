            <h2>Course Summary</h2>
            <p>
              The Fundamentals of Computer Engineering course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive overview of the field of computer engineering, both academically and professionally. The main objective of the course is to help students develop a fundamental understanding of the pillars upon which the discipline is built, including mathematics, physics, anthropology, and ethics. Additionally, the course aims to familiarize students with the various career opportunities available and the crucial role that computer engineers play in today's society.
            </p>
            <p>
              The course is divided into two parts. The first part focuses on the theoretical foundations of computer engineering, exploring the following content blocks:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Computer Engineering in Society</strong>: The historical background, definitions, and basic concepts of computer engineering are analyzed, as well as its evolution over time, its role in today's society, and its impact on the world.</li>
              <li><strong>Current Paradigms and Trends in Systems and Applications</strong>: The basic concepts of software engineering, software development, the structure of computer systems, new paradigms and trends in computing, such as cloud computing, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, smart cities, and IoT (Internet of Things) are introduced.</li>
              <li><strong>Information and Data</strong>: The basic concepts of information and data are explored, including information representation, number systems, information coding, and the foundations of data science.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The second part of the course focuses on the development of practical skills, focusing on the learning of the following content blocks:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Introduction to Software Repositories</strong>: The basic concepts of software repositories, such as Git and GitHub, and their importance in software development are introduced.</li>
              <li><strong>Creating HTML5 Web Pages</strong>: The basic concepts of creating HTML5 web pages are learned, including the structure of a web page, the DOM (Document Object Model), forms, and containers.</li>
              <li><strong>Design and Layout with CSS3</strong>: The basic concepts of design and layout with CSS3 are learned, including CSS elements, box and float models, and element positioning.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The course is taught through a combination of theoretical classes, practical classes, and workshops, which foster active learning and teamwork. The course is assessed through theoretical and practical exams, as well as through the completion of projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Fundamentals of Computer Engineering course is an excellent introduction to the discipline of computer engineering, providing students with a solid foundation for further study and development in this field.
