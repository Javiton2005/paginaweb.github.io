The most complicated thing i found out during the time i made this website is the logic in the use of clases and id's, i found the diferent bit it is hard to locate them in the css file, for example, how can i select a div with a class that it is inside another div with another class, it was with something as #id1<.class1 

another thing that i stragle it the most is how to resize the images inside divs that it is something cuit a bit tricky
 
my work,i started with the about me page and you can notice that it is better done than the rest of them.
In the topic page i talked about a theme that i'm traying to learn a lot this last couple of weeks automatization with python

This is a harder work that what i thought, i ejoyed a lot, but next time i will designed better first and think everithing before startiung to code it
